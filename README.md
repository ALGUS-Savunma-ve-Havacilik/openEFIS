# openEFIS
An EFIS system for aircraft. Uses small, inexpensive sensors through an Arduino board.
Includes an autopilot capable of flying multi-engine drone type VTOL craft, or fixed wing aircraft,
everything from a Cessna 172 to a 747.

To understand the code structure, see Readme.odg

Currently uses X-Plane for display. That me have to change because X-Plane does not properly display
instruments such as airspeed.
