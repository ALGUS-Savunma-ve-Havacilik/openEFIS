        # For each range of airspeeds, there are different PID tuning parameters.
        # That is because as the airspeed gets lower, controls get "mushy", or need more
        # deflection to effect the same response.
        # The AirSpeedCategories is a list of 2-tuples containing the airspeed min and max for that
        # category index. The index of the airspeed is found by walking through the list.
        # The airspeed index is then used to index into the PID tuning parameters to find which
        # set should be used.
        # In order to avoid rapid oscillation between parameter sets, a hysteresis is employed.
